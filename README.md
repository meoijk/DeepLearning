# DeepLearning

### A few optimization methods were implemented from scratch. ###

A deep neural network model was implemented from scratch only for educational purposes.

In this example, the nonlinear time-delay differential equation Mackey-Glass equation was solved. Later it is used for training a DL model (former multilayer perceptron). Consequently, the trained model was used to predict future states.
